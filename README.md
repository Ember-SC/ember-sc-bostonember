One of our members, [Corbin Uselton](https://github.com/corbinu), has been successful in getting the tutorial
to run at Ember-CLI version 0.0.37 up to the point of attempting to connect with the Rails app.  This is the
code he has at this point.

If you are interested in following along, installation instructions can be found in part 1 of the tutorial above.

If you get further than we have, we would appreciate a PR from you, thanks!
